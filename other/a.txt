when user is remvoed/ they leave, recalcualtate title if there is no set title

filter out current user when loading each chatroom title on signin, unless better method

May not need memberUid data in each "/chats"

in ChatroomsContext, check if I really need to also assign the chatid in the data, as well as the key

see if I can combine the membersContext addmember and updatemember things(if they work first), and is that like fine


!!!!!!!!!LATTTESSSSSSSSSSSSST
  - Was working on the firstmessageID stuff, well I think I finished it, but test it - also I didnt add like whenever a chat is created, it will not know if the firstmessage,


figure out this whole useEffect deal, like whend o I use dependcies and how it actually works, and im I even using themn right, and do I even need half of them
also figure out the useMemo stuff with each component and the useContext that I thought prevented running calcualtions


Was working on messagesContext.jsx and problem was if I have the message logic there, then I will also need like the numUnread for the current chat
  and also like scroll position flags to know if to add to unread count, but thats just wierd, keeping the scroll position flag in the context
  So i could like find a way to efficiently have it see if messages updates without it being like a useEffect listener watsit
