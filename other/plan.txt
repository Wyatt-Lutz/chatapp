We will have authContext similar to vid
Also have chatcontext or someting in in which
  Firebase has a users section and and a chats section
    users
      email
      password
      pfp
      uids that have chatted with
    chats
      chatID
      messages
        message
        timestamp
        user or something
  So the app loads the chats the user has chatted with but not any of the messages, just the dm from the home page
  Then when user clicks on the chat, it then loads the messages by having the chatID be the two uids added together
  Im not sure if ill use chatcontext but I will probably use useReducer
