  Firebase has a users section and and a chats section
    users
      email
      password
      pfp
      uids that have chatted with
    chats
      chatID
      messages
        message
        timestamp
        user or something
  So the app loads the chats the user has chatted with but not any of the messages, just the dm from the home page
  Then when user clicks on the chat, it then loads the messages by having the chatID be the two uids added together
  Im not sure if ill use chatcontext but I will probably use useReducer



So well have groupdm
in whcih it is created by one user who can add multiple users to it on creation in the addUser function
so the chatID should be the addition of all the user ids from largest to smallest, but since the uids are hexademical, I may need to use numbers

Also each user has a userChats document of all the chats they are in with chatID and recipeitns, not messages


so if we click on an empty chat then we need to have error handling so that if there is no messages array then just have div, "its empty in here" or something



add implementation for undread messages

add implementation to prevent spamming



BIG:
  I need to prevent having to pay for this so try and minizmze write and read requests
  documnet max size is 1 MiB so find some way around this like deleting chats after number reached in database

Layout:
  Sidebar of Dm's
  Main Chat area
    - timestamp
    - Search functionality


  Controls area (Settings, friends, profile )
  Settings
    change password
    cahnge email
    Block list
    Logout
