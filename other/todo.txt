-Signin
  - Add signup button

-Signup
  - Email verification // turn it off so that i can use fake emails
  - Think I need to prevent duplicate usernames becauser of adding people to chats

-chats
  -Make sure chats doesnt run when you initially sign in
  - Make it so the listnere subscribes only after fetchChats finishes everything
-Sidebar
  - when the chat is created, automatically go to the chat, dont know how to do that rn
  - With each chatName / recipeints for chat name, have ... for the limit of the name like 'Literally Lob...'
  - Sort the chatbar for most recent chatted in on top, need to add a timestamp or something

-app
  - Add too many auth requests functionality as a context component surrounding the app
    - If the error.code === 'auth/too-many-requests' then setTimeout for exponentially increasing timestamp
    - Could change it tho
  - SOmething is wrong with user persistence i think
  - See if I can combine EmailNotVerified and EmailVerification components since the two resendEmail functions are the exact same and so are like the buttons
  - THe Authprotected routes thing is broken, I can go to localhost without having to sign in



-in readme credit lama dev for chat context
