Priority:
1. Error with like blocking a user when you are in the chat, it like adds that user again to memberState
1. There was some issue where I wanted to do something but the import was ref which conflicting with the like firebase ref so I just went with another plan which was probably worse
2. Add the request system
3. When creating a group chat that matches one already, prompt the user if they are sure they want to create it.
6. When someone leaves a group chat, the membersList isnt updated
7. Make like the actual pfps and make username and timestamp on same line with pfp
8. Add image upload implenetations
9. Problems with memberListener and stuff
9. Adding a new chatroom when you are already in one doenst change it to the new chatroom
9. When you are creating a chat and adding the users, add the users profile pictures before their names
9. Add the like "new messages since x time" if a user is scrolled up
10. Fix the layout of search messages
11. Make the Chat and Chatroom listener services


-PasswordReset
  - Optimize it and make it better wiuth change Password, like add

-Chatrooms
  - Consider adding chatroom title and tempTitle listeners


-Settings
  - Test Delete Account
  - Have all the change components dispaly toasts on success
  - For pfp Ill have a separate button near password like - change profile picture
  - Whenever a user changes thier username, tell them in ui that like you can only change it every 10 days, like during the success toast or screen or something

-members
  - Make sure you can block members even if they have been removed or something, because its not like theyre accounts have been deleted


-Signup
  - recieved 2 emails with different bodys to verify account on signup, could be because i clicked complete twice, but either way should only send one
  - improve the flow, like I should have the verification link go to the website or something
  - could preload the default image in signupform
  - Make the form errors toasts or something - well Idk, because its cool when they pop up immedietly like if username.length > 15

-Signup
  - If you press eenter while in the email input to go to the password input, it thinks you tried to signin and gives password error. Or pressing enter doesnt even go to next input in first place and just tries to sign in


-messages
  - the loading thing I do is bad
  - test t he firstmessageid and top of messages, it may be a little glitchy
  - see if there is better ways to handle the unseen messages than all the scroll listeners and checks
  - I think theres like an error if a user loaded a chatroom before midnight, the messages will say Today at 10PM right, but then if its open as the day changes, the old messages I think would still say Today and 10PM even though it was yesterday
  - If a user changes their name, does the title reflect that? - check
  - If mouse is hovered over title change textbox and you hit enter, it stays as textbox because onMouseEnter automatically is invoked after
  - Theres some bugs with the numUnread for just in chat like if youre scrolled up and texts are sent - test to get specifics
  - ADd stuff for it user types more than 200 characters
  - If you have more than 10 chats and you are loading the first chats, It dosnt display the timestamp for the first message that is loaded
  - Check if user online status is false if they change chats
  - Should add something to indicate the top of a chat
  - See if there is a more efficient method with handleClick in which I jsut reset to close the context menu
  - See if there is a more effeicient method to get the timestamp of the last message that had a timestamp, right now I have it stored in localstorage
  - Test to see what happens if a user clicks on a chat as soon as a messaeg is added
  - add optimistic updates (its like so fast I dont even need it, unless I added it without knowing)

Rules -
  - Make sure that users that have the hasbeenremoved are unable to send messages to a chatroom like if it breaks. Add all the rules for things like this

-topbar
  - If the user is chanign title in topbar and they leave it as "", then recalcuate the temptitle and use that
  - Temptitle has the current users name in it

-Sidebar
  - When chatrooms are loading, if the users wifi is really slow, it will hit the 1.5 second limit and say you arent in any chats when they are still loading
  - in the addUser, test if I cant remove the [0] since its just one object
  - Set a maxmiumum number of users that can be in a group chat - like 50 or something
  - Take off any spaces at the end of a username when adding users if they accidentally added it
  - when the chat is created, automatically go to the chat, dont know how to do that rn
  - With each chatName / recipeints for chat name, have ... for the limit of the name like 'Literally Lob...'
  - Sort the chatbar for most recent chatted in on top, need to add a timestamp or something

-app
  - use .trim() where neccessary - like searching usernames, messages, signing in/up, etc
  - using react-hook-form for like just one input is overkill, just do simple useState thing
  - It doesnt like me calling resetAllChatContexts from like membercontextprovider or mesasge because its under chatcontext and I reset chatcontext first
  - the services are for all functions that access the database, so move any non-database get or set functions to some utils thing.
  - use react-hook-form useWatch instead of its watch
  - see if I can avoid reinitializing like currUser or DB and pass them to componenets in a lifecycle like in Settings
  - make sure I dont set any jsx to like a useState, should only store data there
  - set default values to function parameters that are optional, as it they may not be there. Also do this for components like Messages component
  - make a progress bar hook if needed
  - it says authenticaitng... on like signup and signin when not signed in, probably because auth wraps everything
  - fix our horrible folder system, and also some name things, like I have a main.jsx and Main.jsx
  - See if I dont have to pass the dispatch functions and db and whatnot to the service functions
  - Add destructuring everywhere where necessary
  -HUGEEE USE GETVALUES INSTEAD OF WATCH TO AVOID RE-RENDERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  -IF I HAVE TO USE WATCH PROVIDE DEFAULT VALUES
  - See if the UsernameAvalaibility is a performance liability - since the component re-renders on every change to the textboxes
  - Do all the toasts, make some toasts manager component or somthing - look at spencers app for all those manager things
  - Debate whether I should use url redirect with sending verification emails, if I do want it -> When I have this working for wyattlutz.com, make sure to set the actionCodeSettings for sending emails to the right url and also set my website as an authorized website on firebase
  - Allow the user to change their email on the emailNotVerified component, use the change email component I guess
  - I neeeeed some error handler api thing
      - Make sure I add too many requests
  - Add all the input error handling and all the messages
  - I am importing like app and chatID in all my service functions - see if I can not have to do this, like just import in the file or something
  - Change all the .then() to await
  - When I delete an account, change email address, or change password, I have to reauthenticate with reauthenticateWithCredential if user signed in too long ago
  - Do a full test with signing up and signing in witht he new verifcation system
  - Add like a page doenst exist page
  - Find anywhere I can reduce database calls (and learn a conventional method to do so like batching calls). One place is createChat when I loop over uids
  - Check in useEffects with listeners if I realy need the initialmount check
  - Add too many auth requests functionality as a context component surrounding the app
    - If the error.code === 'auth/too-many-requests' then setTimeout for exponentially increasing timestamp
    - Could change it tho
  - SOmething is wrong with user persistence i think
  - See if I can combine EmailNotVerified and EmailVerification components since the two resendEmail functions are the exact same and so are like the buttons
  - THe Authprotected routes thing is broken, I can go to localhost without having to sign in
  - Need to add some incentives to verify email, like prevent them from doing things
  - Clicking in the home page anywhere will rerender chatRoomSiderbar and chatrooms because of the onClick listner from useContextMenu.js

-in readme credit lama dev for chat context
   - link youtube video on the words lama dev if possilbe



Was going to start to work on furhter implementations
  LATTTESSSSSSSSSSSSST!!!!!!!!!!!!!
    - Add the plugin that hides tailwind code: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBIjgBVFjVI&ab_channel=Fireship at 2:26
    - Do block list in settings, make it a drop down so like : Blocked Users (+) -> dynamically loaded
      - and then its a list of all the users with a minus next to it
    - Also make it so if a user is deleted think about making it so it just says deleted User, but then I have to have some check if theyre deleted or osmething

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fONene3OIA&ab_channel=BeyondFireship - WEBSITE PERFORNACME

  - test that the title changing with topbar works since I changed it after I realized that snap.val() can also be owner if owner changes

  - Was working on members and removing members - it should add the hasBeenRemoved property (whcih is does) and then the chatProvider will see the change, and I want to check if it has the propety, and if it does, remove it from the data.members, otherwise, update the member object
  - When someone removes a user - add a server message
  - If someone is removed and there is only one person left, then delete the chat
  - Make sure to also remove the user from their chatsIn as well, not just memberList - can use Promise.all!!!
  - LOok into what happens if the owner leaves the chat, then who to give owner - also add user leaving and user adding implenmentations



  - Need finish like if user changes username because the problem is you cant change a key so I guess ill have to delete then add the new user when changing usernames which is terrible
      - I also need to have useruid connected or something to show pfp unless I can have that reference in the database like I remember something liek that in lamadev video

  - Before I merge componentization, find out why chat component console.log runs as many chats as there are when you fetch more chats, it should only run 10 chats not 30 if there were already 20 for example
  - Then fix unread bugs - related to members list
  - Start on members list and everything - pfps

  - Emojis for fun
  - Work on more bugs reported here in todo

  Will have a members thing on the side and each member will be a component and if you I guess right click it
it will show a context menu with block user and remove from group if you are the owner of the group and are in a chat

Also will have message group requests inviting each user - will need like a tab to show your message requests sent to you
  - Can also have like a pending thing - like maybe i add each user to the member list then had pending below their name if its stil pending and them remove thier name if the click no

Owner system - only owner can remove members (maybe anyone can add)

Before I do this I n

each chat sender will be the useruid to account for username changes and will fetch each members username with their useruid from the client and store them
