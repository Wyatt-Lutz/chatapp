-Signin
  - Add signup button

-Signup
  - When they sign up, send them to the home screen
  - If the username has a space at the end, then just take it off, do the same with like email I guess
  - Flip the positions of Return to signup and resend verifcation email buttons
  - Think I need to prevent duplicate usernames becauser of adding people to chats

-chats
  - I should take out the naming the chat and instead just have it automatically name the chat as the name of the members. Then have a button next to the name of the chat after they created it to change the name - only if more than 2 people in chat
  - Fix the whole scrolling thing, it maybe be css related who knows
  - See if I can optimize something with the chats listener because whenever you delete a message, it looks weird
  - Do testing with react query like what happens if I click off of the app, will data still be fetched from the listener and when I click back what happens because I turned that off
  - Think if I should add an eddited tag if a message is eddited like discord. Would just add a hasBeenEdited bool to each message and check in jsx
  - Test to see what happens if a user clicks on a chat as soon as a messaeg is added
     - it may bug out because queryClient is undefined
  - Get the whole limiting chats to last 50 or whatever to work, and also with fetching more chats
  - Make sure chats doesnt run when you initially sign in
  - Make it so the listnere subscribes only after fetchChats finishes everything
  - if first chat in room (and maybe only if you crteate chat, need to test) then it doesnt show the first chat until you or probably other user sends a second one
-Sidebar
  - Take off any spaces at the end of a username when adding users if they accidentally added it
  - when the chat is created, automatically go to the chat, dont know how to do that rn
  - With each chatName / recipeints for chat name, have ... for the limit of the name like 'Literally Lob...'
  - Sort the chatbar for most recent chatted in on top, need to add a timestamp or something

-app
  - Check in useEffects with listeners if I realy need the initialmount check
  - Add too many auth requests functionality as a context component surrounding the app
    - If the error.code === 'auth/too-many-requests' then setTimeout for exponentially increasing timestamp
    - Could change it tho
  - SOmething is wrong with user persistence i think
  - See if I can combine EmailNotVerified and EmailVerification components since the two resendEmail functions are the exact same and so are like the buttons
  - THe Authprotected routes thing is broken, I can go to localhost without having to sign in
  - Need to add some incentives to verify email, like prevent them from doing things
